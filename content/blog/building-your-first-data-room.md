# Building Your First Data Room: What Investors Expect to See

You've got investor interest. They want to see your data room. If you're thinking "What's a data room?"—you're not alone. Here's everything you need to know.

## What Is a Data Room?

A data room (or virtual data room) is a secure online repository where you store documents for investor due diligence. When an investor is seriously considering your startup, they'll request access to review your:

- Corporate documents
- Financial information
- Legal agreements
- Team information
- Product and technology details

Think of it as your startup's filing cabinet, organised for investor scrutiny.

## When to Build Your Data Room

**Ideal timing:** 2-4 weeks before you start actively fundraising.

**Don't wait until investors ask.** Having a well-organised data room ready signals professionalism and preparedness. Scrambling to gather documents after an investor requests them creates delays and poor impressions.

## Data Room Tools

Popular options:

| Tool | Best For | Cost |
|------|----------|------|
| **Google Drive** | Early stage, simple needs | Free |
| **Notion** | Integrated with other docs | Free-£8/user |
| **DocSend** | Tracking, analytics | £45/month |
| **Dropbox** | Simple sharing | £10-15/month |
| **Dealroom** | Serious M&A, later stage | £100+/month |

For pre-seed and seed rounds, Google Drive or Notion is usually sufficient. Upgrade to DocSend if you want tracking (see who opened which documents).

## Data Room Structure

Here's the folder structure investors expect:

```
📁 [Company Name] Data Room
├── 📁 1. Company Overview
├── 📁 2. Corporate Documents
├── 📁 3. Financials
├── 📁 4. Legal
├── 📁 5. Team
├── 📁 6. Product & Technology
├── 📁 7. Customers & Traction
├── 📁 8. Fundraising
└── 📁 9. Appendix
```

## Data Room Best Practices

### 1. Name Files Clearly

**Bad:** `Document1.pdf`, `Final_FINAL_v3.xlsx`

**Good:** `2025-01-CapTable.xlsx`, `2024-CustomerContract-Acme.pdf`

Use consistent naming: `[Date]-[Type]-[Description].[ext]`

### 2. Keep Documents Current

Update your data room regularly. Stale information erodes trust. Add a "Last Updated" date to key documents.

### 3. Use PDF for Final Documents

Convert Word docs and spreadsheets to PDF for:
- Corporate documents
- Contracts
- Policies

Keep Excel/Sheets format for:
- Financial models (investors want to play with assumptions)
- Cap tables

### 4. Create a README

Add a document at the top level explaining:
- What's in each folder
- Key contacts for questions
- Last update date

### 5. Control Access

- Use view-only sharing initially
- Grant download access selectively
- Track who accesses what (DocSend)
- Revoke access when round closes or discussions end

### 6. Prepare for Questions

Anticipate follow-up questions and either:
- Include answers in the data room
- Have responses ready to send quickly

Common follow-ups:
- "Can we see the last 12 months of bank statements?"
- "What are the assumptions behind your revenue projections?"
- "Can we speak with a customer reference?"

## What NOT to Include

- **Confidential customer data** without consent
- **Source code** (unless specifically requested)
- **Personal information** beyond what's necessary
- **Incomplete documents** (better to omit than include drafts)
- **Aspirational documents** presented as current (be honest about status)

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Disorganised Structure
Dumping everything in one folder makes investors work harder. They'll question your operational capabilities.

### 2. Missing Key Documents
The absence of basics (cap table, financials, incorporation docs) suggests you're not prepared.

### 3. Outdated Information
Financials from 6 months ago or a pitch deck with old metrics looks sloppy.

### 4. Over-Sharing Too Early
Don't share sensitive customer contracts or detailed IP before you have a term sheet. Start with the basics.

### 5. Inconsistent Numbers
If your pitch deck says £50k MRR but your P&L says £35k, investors will notice. Ensure consistency.

## Data Room Timeline

| Fundraising Stage | Data Room Action |
|-------------------|------------------|
| **2-4 weeks before outreach** | Build and organise data room |
| **Initial meetings** | Share pitch deck only |
| **After positive meetings** | Share data room access |
| **Due diligence phase** | Respond to requests, add documents |
| **Post-close** | Revoke external access |

## The Bottom Line

A well-organised data room:
- Signals professionalism
- Builds investor confidence
- Accelerates due diligence
- Reduces back-and-forth

Invest the time upfront. The payoff is faster closes and better investor relationships.
