# When Should You Hire a Fractional CTO? 7 Signs Your Startup Is Ready

The question isn't whether you need technical leadership—every tech startup does. The question is whether you need it full-time, or whether a fractional CTO makes more sense for your stage.

Here are seven clear signs that your startup is ready for a fractional CTO.

## 1. You're a Non-Technical Founder Making Technical Decisions

If you're choosing between React and Vue, deciding whether to use AWS or GCP, or evaluating development agencies without the expertise to assess their recommendations, you're taking unnecessary risks.

**The problem:** Every wrong technical decision compounds. Choose the wrong architecture early, and you'll pay for it with expensive rewrites later.

**A fractional CTO helps by:** Translating your business requirements into sound technical decisions, evaluating vendors and contractors, and ensuring you're building on solid foundations.

## 2. Your Developers Are Great at Coding, But...

You have talented developers shipping features. But who's thinking about:

- System architecture and scalability?
- Security and compliance?
- Technical debt management?
- Team structure as you grow?

Individual contributors, no matter how skilled, aren't necessarily equipped for strategic technical leadership. They're focused on the code in front of them—which is exactly what you want them doing.

**A fractional CTO helps by:** Providing the strategic layer above day-to-day development. They ensure your technical decisions align with your business goals and growth trajectory.

## 3. You're Preparing to Fundraise

Investors will ask detailed technical questions during due diligence:

- "Walk me through your architecture."
- "What's your scalability plan?"
- "How do you handle data security?"
- "What's your technical debt situation?"

If you can't answer these confidently, you'll lose credibility—and potentially the deal.

**A fractional CTO helps by:** Preparing due diligence materials, attending investor meetings as your technical voice, and building confidence in your technical foundation.

## 4. Development Costs Are Spiraling Without Clear ROI

You're spending £20k, £30k, £50k per month on development, but you're not sure if you're getting value. Features take longer than expected. Bugs keep appearing. The roadmap feels disconnected from reality.

**The problem:** Without senior technical oversight, it's impossible to know if you're being efficient or burning money.

**A fractional CTO helps by:** Auditing your current development processes, identifying inefficiencies, setting realistic expectations, and ensuring you're spending wisely.

## 5. You Can't Afford a Full-Time CTO

A full-time CTO in London costs £150,000-£220,000 in salary alone—plus equity, benefits, employer NI, and recruitment fees. All-in, you're looking at £210,000-£320,000+ in Year 1.

If that's not in your budget, you have two choices: go without technical leadership (risky) or find a more cost-effective solution.

**A fractional CTO helps by:** Providing senior technical leadership at 60-80% less than a full-time hire, with no equity dilution and no recruitment fees.

| | Fractional CTO | Full-Time CTO |
|---|---|---|
| Annual Cost | £48k-£180k | £210k-£320k+ |
| Equity | 0% | 1-4% |
| Time to Start | 1-2 weeks | 3-6 months |

## 6. You're Growing but Don't Know How to Scale the Team

You've got 2-3 developers and you're ready to grow to 5-8. But you're unsure about:

- What roles to hire for
- How to structure the team
- What interview process to use
- How to evaluate technical candidates

Hiring the wrong people is expensive—both in direct costs and lost productivity.

**A fractional CTO helps by:** Defining your engineering team structure, creating job descriptions, running technical interviews, and ensuring you hire the right people.

## 7. You Need Someone in the Room

Whether it's investor meetings, board presentations, enterprise sales calls, or partnership discussions, you sometimes need a credible technical voice representing your company.

Non-technical founders often feel at a disadvantage in these situations—and rightly so. Technical stakeholders want to talk to technical leaders.

**A fractional CTO helps by:** Attending key meetings, speaking credibly about your technology, and building confidence with stakeholders who care about technical capability.

## When a Fractional CTO Isn't Right

To be fair, fractional isn't always the answer. You might need a full-time CTO if:

- You have 15+ engineers requiring daily leadership
- Technology is your core competitive moat (novel algorithms, custom hardware)
- You need 40+ hours per week of technical leadership
- You've raised significant capital and can justify the investment

But for most pre-seed to Series A startups, fractional provides the leadership you need while preserving runway.

## The Bottom Line

If you recognized yourself in 3+ of these signs, it's probably time to explore fractional CTO support. You don't need to wait until you can afford a full-time executive—and you shouldn't wait until the technical problems become too expensive to fix.
