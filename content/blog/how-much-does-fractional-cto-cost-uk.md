If you're considering fractional CTO support for your startup, the first question is usually: "What does it cost?"

## Cost Comparison: Fractional vs Full-Time

Here's why the fractional model makes financial sense for most early-stage startups:

| Cost Component | Fractional CTO | Full-Time CTO |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Annual Fee/Salary | £48,000-£180,000 | £150,000-£220,000 |
| Employer NI | £0 | £18,000-£26,000 |
| Pension | £0 | £6,000-£9,000 |
| Benefits | £0 | £5,000-£15,000 |
| Recruitment Fee | £0 | £30,000-£50,000 |
| Equity | 0% | 1-4% |
| **Year 1 Total** | **£48,000-£180,000** | **£210,000-£320,000+** |

**Savings: £130,000-£200,000 in Year 1**, plus you avoid equity dilution and recruitment risk.

## What Affects Pricing?

### 1. Experience Level

A fractional CTO who's built and scaled multiple startups commands higher rates than someone newer to the role. You're paying for:

- Pattern recognition (they've seen your problems before)
- Network access (introductions to talent, investors, partners)
- Credibility (their name carries weight)

### 2. Industry Specialisation

Specialists in regulated industries (fintech, healthtech) typically charge premium rates because:

- Compliance knowledge is valuable and rare
- Mistakes in these areas are expensive
- Domain expertise accelerates decisions

### 3. Engagement Intensity

More hours per week = higher total cost, but often better value per hour. Intensive engagements typically offer:

- Better context and continuity
- Faster decision-making
- Deeper team relationships

### 4. Location

London-based fractional CTOs typically charge 10-20% more than those outside the capital, reflecting:

- Higher cost of living
- Better access to startup ecosystem
- In-person availability for meetings

## How to Budget for a Fractional CTO

### Pre-Seed (£100k-£500k raised)
**Budget: £2,000-£4,000/month**

At this stage, you're validating your idea and building an MVP. A light-touch engagement provides:
- Architecture guidance from day one
- Avoiding expensive early mistakes
- Technical credibility for investor conversations

### Seed (£500k-£2M raised)
**Budget: £4,000-£8,000/month**

You're building your product and team. A standard engagement provides:
- Regular technical leadership
- Hiring support as you grow
- Due diligence preparation

### Series A (£2M-£10M raised)
**Budget: £8,000-£15,000/month**

You're scaling rapidly. An intensive engagement provides:
- Full technical leadership coverage
- Engineering team management
- Board-level reporting

## ROI of a Fractional CTO

The value isn't just in what you save versus a full-time hire. It's in:

**Mistakes avoided:**
- Choosing wrong technology stack: £50,000-£200,000 rebuild
- Bad technical hire: £100,000+ including severance and rehiring
- Security breach: £10,000-£1M+ depending on severity

**Efficiency gained:**
- Faster development cycles
- Better vendor negotiations
- Cleaner architecture reducing future costs

**Opportunities captured:**
- Passing due diligence (closing your round)
- Winning enterprise customers who care about technical credibility
- Attracting better engineering talent

## Questions to Ask About Pricing

When evaluating fractional CTO options, ask:

1. **"What's included in your retainer?"**
   Ensure you understand the scope and hours.

2. **"How do you handle overflow work?"**
   Know what happens if you need more time in a given month.

3. **"What's not included?"**
   Clarify boundaries around hands-on coding, 24/7 availability, etc.

4. **"What's your notice period?"**
   Most fractional engagements are monthly with 30-day notice.

5. **"Do you take equity?"**
   Most fractional CTOs work on cash retainer only. Be wary of equity-first pricing—it often signals they're not confident in their value.

## The Bottom Line

Fractional CTO services in the UK typically cost:

- **Light Touch:** £2,000-£4,000/month
- **Standard:** £4,000-£8,000/month
- **Intensive:** £8,000-£15,000/month

For most pre-seed to Series A startups, this represents **60-80% savings** versus a full-time CTO hire, with:

- Zero equity dilution
- Zero recruitment fees
- Flexible commitment
- Faster time to start

The question isn't whether you can afford a fractional CTO—it's whether you can afford to make technical decisions without one.
