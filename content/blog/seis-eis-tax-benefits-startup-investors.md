# SEIS and EIS Explained: UK Tax Benefits for Startup Investors

If you're raising money for a UK startup, understanding SEIS and EIS isn't optional—it's essential. These schemes offer significant tax benefits to investors, making your startup more attractive to angels and early-stage funds.

Here's everything founders need to know.

## What Are SEIS and EIS?

**SEIS (Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme)** and **EIS (Enterprise Investment Scheme)** are UK government programs designed to encourage investment in early-stage companies by offering tax relief to investors.

For investors, these schemes dramatically reduce the risk of startup investment. For founders, they're a powerful incentive that can help close rounds faster.

## SEIS: Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme

SEIS is designed for the earliest stage companies.

### Tax Benefits for Investors

| Benefit | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Income Tax Relief** | 50% of investment amount |
| **Capital Gains Tax Exemption** | No CGT on SEIS gains if held 3+ years |
| **Loss Relief** | Offset losses against income tax |
| **CGT Reinvestment Relief** | Defer CGT from other gains |

**Example:** An investor puts £100,000 into your SEIS-qualifying startup.
- Immediate tax relief: £50,000 (50% of investment)
- Net cost to investor: £50,000
- If the startup fails completely, loss relief further reduces their exposure

### SEIS Limits and Requirements

**Investment limits:**
- Maximum £250,000 lifetime investment per company
- Maximum £200,000 per investor per tax year

**Company requirements:**
- Less than £350,000 in gross assets before investment
- Fewer than 25 employees
- Less than 3 years old
- Carrying on a qualifying trade
- No previous EIS/VCT investment

**Investor requirements:**
- Cannot own more than 30% of the company
- Cannot be an employee (directors are ok)
- Must hold shares for minimum 3 years for full relief

## EIS: Enterprise Investment Scheme

EIS is for slightly more mature early-stage companies.

### Tax Benefits for Investors

| Benefit | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Income Tax Relief** | 30% of investment amount |
| **Capital Gains Tax Exemption** | No CGT on EIS gains if held 3+ years |
| **Loss Relief** | Offset losses against income tax |
| **CGT Deferral Relief** | Defer CGT from other gains |
| **Inheritance Tax Relief** | Shares exempt from IHT after 2 years |

**Example:** An investor puts £500,000 into your EIS-qualifying startup.
- Immediate tax relief: £150,000 (30% of investment)
- Net cost to investor: £350,000
- Plus CGT deferral on other gains, IHT benefits, loss relief if things go wrong

### EIS Limits and Requirements

**Investment limits:**
- Maximum £5 million per year per company (£12M lifetime)
- Maximum £1 million per investor per tax year (£2M for knowledge-intensive companies)

**Company requirements:**
- Fewer than £15 million in gross assets (£16M after investment)
- Fewer than 250 employees
- Less than 7 years old (10 for knowledge-intensive companies)
- Carrying on a qualifying trade
- Permanent establishment in the UK

**Investor requirements:**
- Cannot own more than 30% of the company
- Cannot be an employee (directors are ok)
- Must hold shares for minimum 3 years

## SEIS vs EIS: Quick Comparison

| Factor | SEIS | EIS |
|--------|------|-----|
| Income Tax Relief | 50% | 30% |
| Company Age | < 3 years | < 7 years |
| Company Size | < 25 employees | < 250 employees |
| Assets Limit | < £350k | < £15M |
| Max Raise/Year | £250k | £5M |
| Investor Max/Year | £200k | £1M |

## What Disqualifies a Company?

Both schemes exclude certain activities. Your startup won't qualify if it primarily involves:

- Property development
- Financial services (with exceptions)
- Legal or accountancy services
- Farming
- Hotels, nursing homes
- Coal or steel production
- Shipbuilding
- Energy generation (some exceptions for renewables)

Most tech startups—SaaS, marketplaces, fintech, healthtech—are eligible.

## How to Become SEIS/EIS Qualifying

### Step 1: Advance Assurance

Before raising, apply to HMRC for "advance assurance." This confirms your company qualifies for the scheme and gives investors confidence.

**You'll need:**
- Business plan
- Financial projections
- Company structure details
- Description of qualifying trade

Processing time: 4-6 weeks typically, though HMRC aims for 15 working days.

### Step 2: Issue Shares and Claim Relief

After investment:
1. Issue shares to investors
2. Submit compliance statement (SEIS1/EIS1) to HMRC
3. HMRC issues compliance certificates (SEIS3/EIS3)
4. Investors use certificates to claim tax relief

### Step 3: Maintain Compliance

For the 3-year minimum holding period, ensure:
- The company continues qualifying trade
- You don't repay investors' capital
- Investors don't become employees
- Company structure doesn't breach rules

## Tips for Founders

### 1. Get Advance Assurance Early
Apply before you start fundraising. Having HMRC confirmation makes investor conversations much easier.

### 2. Structure Your Round Properly
If raising more than £250k, structure as SEIS for the first £250k, then EIS for the rest. This maximizes investor tax benefits.

### 3. Work with Experienced Advisors
SEIS/EIS has nuances and traps. Use a lawyer and accountant who specialize in startup fundraising to ensure compliance.

### 4. Document Everything
Keep clear records of:
- Shareholder agreements
- Board minutes
- Use of funds
- Trade activities

This protects you if HMRC queries eligibility later.

### 5. Communicate with Investors
Ensure investors understand:
- The holding period requirement (3 years minimum)
- Restrictions on their involvement
- Timeline for receiving tax certificates

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Raising Before Advance Assurance**
If you raise without advance assurance and HMRC later determines you don't qualify, investors lose their tax relief. Some may have legal recourse against you.

**2. Exceeding Limits**
Raising more than £250k in SEIS or £5M in EIS per year breaches limits. Structure your round carefully.

**3. Connected Persons**
Investors who are "connected" to the company (e.g., substantial shareholders, employees) may not qualify. Understand the rules.

**4. Non-Qualifying Trade**
If your business model involves excluded activities, you won't qualify. Get professional advice on borderline cases.

**5. Post-Investment Changes**
Changing your business model, structure, or activities after raising can breach compliance and claw back tax relief.

## The Bottom Line for Founders

SEIS and EIS are powerful tools for UK startups:

- **SEIS** offers 50% tax relief for investments up to £250k
- **EIS** offers 30% tax relief for investments up to £5M per year
- Combined with loss relief, investors' downside is significantly protected

This makes UK startups more attractive than equivalents in many other countries. Use it.
