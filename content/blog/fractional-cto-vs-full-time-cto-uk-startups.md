# Fractional CTO vs Full-Time CTO: The Real Cost Analysis for UK Startups

You've built something that's gaining traction. Investors are asking about your technical roadmap. Your lead developer is great at shipping code but struggles with architecture decisions. You need technical leadership—but should you hire a full-time CTO or bring in a fractional one?

This isn't just a cost question. It's a strategic decision that affects your runway, your ability to raise, and your product's long-term viability. After working with 15+ UK startups across fintech, healthtech, and B2B SaaS, here's the honest breakdown.

## The True Cost of a Full-Time CTO

Let's start with numbers that UK founders often underestimate.

### Direct Costs

| Component | London Range | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Base Salary** | £150,000 - £220,000 | Senior CTOs from strong backgrounds |
| **Equity** | 1-4% | Vesting over 4 years, but immediate dilution |
| **Employer NI** | £18,000 - £26,000 | 13.8% on salary above threshold |
| **Pension** | £6,000 - £9,000 | 3% minimum employer contribution |
| **Benefits** | £5,000 - £15,000 | Health insurance, equipment, training |
| **Recruitment** | £30,000 - £50,000 | 20-25% of first year salary (one-time) |

**Total Year 1 Cost: £210,000 - £320,000** (plus equity dilution)

### Hidden Costs Most Founders Miss

**1. Hiring Time**
A CTO search typically takes 3-6 months. During that time, technical decisions either stall or get made poorly. I've seen startups lose entire funding windows because their architecture couldn't support due diligence requirements.

**2. Wrong Hire Risk**
Approximately 40% of executive hires don't work out within the first 18 months. At £200k+ all-in cost, that's a potential £300k+ mistake including severance, re-hiring, and lost momentum.

**3. Opportunity Cost**
A founder spending 20 hours/week on a CTO search for 4 months is 320 hours not spent on customers, fundraising, or product. At seed stage, that's often the difference between closing a round or not.

**4. Overhiring for Current Needs**
A full-time CTO capable of scaling to 50 engineers is overkill when you have 3 developers. You're paying for capabilities you won't need for 2-3 years—if ever.

## The Fractional CTO Model

A fractional CTO works with your startup part-time (typically 2-4 days per week) on a retainer basis, providing the same strategic leadership without the full-time overhead.

### Typical Fractional CTO Costs

| Engagement Level | Monthly Retainer | Equivalent Annual |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Light Touch** (1 day/week) | £3,000 - £5,000 | £36,000 - £60,000 |
| **Standard** (2 days/week) | £6,000 - £10,000 | £72,000 - £120,000 |
| **Intensive** (3-4 days/week) | £10,000 - £18,000 | £120,000 - £216,000 |

**No equity dilution. No employer NI. No recruitment fees. No benefits overhead.**

### What You Actually Get

A good fractional CTO provides:

- **Technical Strategy** — Architecture decisions, build vs buy, technology selection
- **Team Leadership** — Hiring support, engineering culture, developer mentorship
- **Investor Readiness** — Technical due diligence prep, CTO-in-meetings for fundraising
- **Vendor Management** — Contract negotiation, AWS/GCP optimization, tool selection
- **Risk Mitigation** — Security architecture, compliance guidance, disaster recovery

The difference from a consultant? A fractional CTO has accountability for outcomes, not just advice. They're in your Slack, your standups, your board meetings.

## When Full-Time Makes Sense

Full-time CTO hiring is the right choice when:

**1. You're post-Series A with 15+ engineers**
At this scale, the coordination overhead requires dedicated leadership. The cost is justified by the team size.

**2. Deep technical differentiation is your moat**
If you're building proprietary ML models, custom hardware, or novel algorithms, you need someone thinking about that 50 hours/week.

**3. You've found a unicorn candidate**
Occasionally, you find someone who's perfect—culturally aligned, technically brilliant, and willing to join at your stage. Don't let them go.

**4. Your board demands it**
Some institutional investors (particularly US VCs) expect a named CTO. The optics matter, even if the economics don't.

## When Fractional Makes Sense

Fractional CTO engagement is ideal when:

**1. You're pre-seed to Series A**
Your technical needs are real but don't require 40 hours/week of leadership. A fractional CTO can cover strategy while your senior developers handle execution.

**2. Your runway is under 18 months**
A £200k+ CTO hire consumes runway fast. Fractional gives you the expertise without the burn rate increase.

**3. You need to move fast**
Fractional CTOs can start in 1-2 weeks. Full-time searches take 3-6 months. If you're fundraising, building an MVP, or preparing for due diligence, speed matters.

**4. You're a non-technical founder**
You need someone who can translate between business and engineering, attend investor meetings, and make architecture decisions. But you don't need them full-time—yet.

**5. You've been burned before**
If you've had a bad CTO hire, fractional lets you de-risk while still getting leadership. It's also a great "try before you buy" for potential full-time candidates.

## The Hybrid Path: Fractional to Full-Time

Many successful startups use fractional as a bridge:

**Phase 1: Fractional (Months 1-6)**
Fractional CTO establishes architecture, hiring processes, and team culture. Runway is preserved for growth.

**Phase 2: Internal Promotion or Hire (Months 6-12)**
Once you've raised and need to scale, either promote your VP Engineering to CTO (with the fractional as advisor) or hire full-time with clear requirements shaped by the fractional engagement.

**Phase 3: Advisory (Ongoing)**
Many fractional CTOs transition to advisory board roles, providing ongoing guidance at a fraction of the cost.

This path costs roughly £80-150k in Year 1 versus £250k+ for a direct full-time hire—while getting you moving faster and with less risk.

## How to Evaluate a Fractional CTO

Not all fractional CTOs are equal. Here's what to look for:

### Green Flags

- **Relevant industry experience** — Fintech CTO for fintech startup, etc.
- **Founder empathy** — They've built companies, not just worked at them
- **Execution focus** — Strategy paired with hands-on implementation support
- **Clear outcomes** — They talk about results, not just hours
- **Reference-able clients** — Founders who'll take your call

### Red Flags

- **Consultant-speak** — Frameworks and methodologies but no shipping
- **No team experience** — Solo ICs don't become good CTOs
- **Unavailable bandwidth** — Taking on too many clients simultaneously
- **Equity-first compensation** — Fractional should be cash-based; equity is for full-time
- **No technical depth** — Can they actually code, or just draw diagrams?

### Questions to Ask

1. "Walk me through a technical decision you made for a similar-stage startup that didn't work out. What did you learn?"
2. "How do you handle a situation where the engineering team disagrees with your recommendation?"
3. "What's your availability for investor meetings and due diligence calls?"
4. "Who on your past client list can I speak with?"
5. "What does a successful 90-day engagement look like for a company at our stage?"

## The Decision Framework

Use this framework to decide:

| Question | Full-Time CTO | Fractional CTO |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Team size? | 15+ engineers | 1-15 engineers |
| Runway? | 24+ months | Under 18 months |
| Technical moat? | Core differentiator | Important but not primary |
| Hiring timeline? | Can wait 3-6 months | Need leadership in weeks |
| Budget? | £200k+ available | Optimizing burn rate |
| Stage? | Series A+ | Pre-seed to Series A |

**If you answered "Fractional" to 4+ questions, start there.**

## Making It Work: Practical Tips

If you go fractional, set yourself up for success:

**1. Define Clear Outcomes**
Not "provide technical leadership" but "establish CI/CD pipeline, hire 2 senior engineers, prepare technical due diligence documentation."

**2. Integrate Them Properly**
Add to Slack, invite to relevant meetings, introduce to the team. Part-time doesn't mean outsider.

**3. Set Communication Rhythm**
Weekly sync with founders, async availability for urgent questions, monthly board updates.

**4. Plan for Transition**
Build internal capabilities from day one. The goal is to either scale up fractional support or graduate to full-time—not dependency.

## The Bottom Line

For most UK startups between pre-seed and Series A, a fractional CTO is the smarter choice:

- **60-80% cost savings** versus full-time hire
- **Start in weeks**, not months
- **Zero equity dilution**
- **Flexible to scale up or down** with your needs
- **Lower risk** than betting on a single hire

The companies that need a full-time CTO usually know it—they're scaling fast, have raised significant capital, and have complex technical challenges requiring dedicated leadership.

Everyone else? Get the expertise without the overhead. Use the savings to extend runway, hire engineers, or invest in growth.
