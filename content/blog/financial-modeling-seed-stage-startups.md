# Financial Modeling for Seed-Stage Startups: A Practical Guide

You're preparing to raise your seed round. An investor asks: "Walk me through your financial model." If that question makes you nervous, you're not alone. Most first-time founders struggle with financial modeling—not because it's impossibly complex, but because no one teaches you what investors actually want to see.

This guide breaks down exactly how to build a financial model that satisfies investors while helping you run your business better.

## Why Financial Models Matter (Beyond Fundraising)

A financial model isn't just a fundraising document. It's a decision-making tool that answers critical questions:

- **How much runway do we have?** At current burn rate, when do we run out of money?
- **What's our path to profitability?** Which levers (pricing, costs, growth) have the biggest impact?
- **What happens if we miss targets?** How sensitive is our business to changes in key assumptions?

Founders who build models early make better decisions about hiring, pricing, and growth. Those who wait until fundraising often discover uncomfortable truths too late.

## The Three Components Investors Expect

### 1. Revenue Model

Your revenue model should clearly show how money flows into the business. For SaaS companies, this typically includes:

| Metric | What It Shows | Example |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| **MRR/ARR** | Recurring revenue base | £50k MRR = £600k ARR |
| **New MRR** | Revenue from new customers | £8k new MRR this month |
| **Expansion MRR** | Upsells from existing customers | £3k expansion MRR |
| **Churned MRR** | Lost revenue from cancellations | -£2k churned MRR |
| **Net MRR Growth** | Overall monthly change | £9k net new MRR |

**Key insight:** Investors care more about the *quality* of revenue than the *quantity*. A company with £30k MRR and 2% monthly churn is more attractive than one with £50k MRR and 8% churn.

### 2. Unit Economics

Unit economics answer: "Does each customer generate profit?" The two critical metrics:

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**
```
CAC = Total Sales & Marketing Spend / New Customers Acquired

Example: £30,000 spend / 50 new customers = £600 CAC
```

**Lifetime Value (LTV)**
```
LTV = Average Revenue Per User × Gross Margin × Customer Lifetime

Example: £100/month × 80% margin × 24 months = £1,920 LTV
```

**The benchmark:** Investors typically want to see LTV:CAC ratio of at least 3:1. Below 3:1 suggests you're spending too much to acquire customers who don't stick around long enough.

| LTV:CAC Ratio | Interpretation |
|---------------|----------------|
| Below 1:1 | Losing money on every customer—unsustainable |
| 1:1 to 3:1 | Marginal economics—need improvement |
| 3:1 to 5:1 | Healthy—typical for funded startups |
| Above 5:1 | Either very efficient or under-investing in growth |

### 3. Cash Flow Projection

This is where many founders stumble. A cash flow projection shows month-by-month:

- **Cash in:** Revenue collected (not just invoiced)
- **Cash out:** Salaries, software, marketing, rent, etc.
- **Net burn:** Monthly cash decrease
- **Runway:** Months until cash hits zero

**Critical distinction:** Revenue recognised ≠ cash collected. If you invoice annually but customers pay monthly, your cash position differs significantly from your P&L.

## Building Your First Model: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Start with Assumptions

List every assumption explicitly. This makes your model auditable and helps you test scenarios.

**Revenue assumptions:**
- Starting MRR
- Monthly growth rate (new customers)
- Average contract value
- Churn rate
- Expansion rate

**Cost assumptions:**
- Headcount plan (who, when, salary)
- Marketing spend as % of revenue
- Infrastructure costs
- Office/admin costs

### Step 2: Build the Revenue Tab

Create a monthly projection for 24-36 months:

| Month | Starting MRR | New MRR | Expansion | Churn | Ending MRR |
|-------|-------------|---------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Jan | £50,000 | £8,000 | £2,000 | -£2,500 | £57,500 |
| Feb | £57,500 | £9,200 | £2,300 | -£2,875 | £66,125 |
| Mar | £66,125 | £10,600 | £2,600 | -£3,306 | £76,019 |

**Tip:** Don't assume linear growth forever. Model a realistic S-curve where growth rates moderate as you scale.

### Step 3: Build the Costs Tab

Categorise costs by type:

**People costs** (typically 60-70% of spend):
- Engineering salaries
- Sales salaries + commissions
- Operations/support
- Benefits and taxes (add ~15-20% to base salaries)

**Non-people costs:**
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP)
- Software tools (Salesforce, Slack, etc.)
- Marketing programs
- Professional services (legal, accounting)
- Office and admin

### Step 4: Connect to Cash Flow

Pull revenue and costs into a cash flow summary:

| Month | Revenue | Total Costs | Net Burn | Starting Cash | Ending Cash |
|-------|---------|-------------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Jan | £50,000 | £85,000 | -£35,000 | £500,000 | £465,000 |
| Feb | £57,500 | £90,000 | -£32,500 | £465,000 | £432,500 |
| Mar | £66,125 | £95,000 | -£28,875 | £432,500 | £403,625 |

### Step 5: Add Scenario Analysis

Build at least three scenarios:

- **Base case:** Your realistic plan
- **Upside case:** Things go better than expected (faster growth, lower churn)
- **Downside case:** Things go worse (slower growth, higher churn, key hire delays)

This shows investors you've stress-tested your assumptions.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Hockey Stick Projections

Every startup shows explosive growth in Year 3. Investors have seen thousands of hockey sticks that never materialised. Be ambitious but grounded—show *how* you'll achieve growth, not just that you expect it.

### 2. Forgetting Cash Timing

If you close a £120k annual contract in January, you might not see that cash until February or March. Model actual cash receipt timing, not just bookings.

### 3. Underestimating Hiring Costs

A £60k salary costs closer to £75k after benefits, taxes, equipment, and recruiting fees. Budget 20-30% above base salaries.

### 4. Ignoring Churn

First-time founders often project 0-1% monthly churn. Reality for early-stage B2B SaaS is typically 3-5% monthly. Be realistic—investors will challenge optimistic churn assumptions.

### 5. No Sensitivity Analysis

What happens if growth is 20% slower than planned? If CAC increases 30%? Models without sensitivity analysis suggest you haven't thought through risks.

## What Investors Actually Look At

Based on conversations with seed and Series A investors, here's what they focus on:

1. **Assumptions clarity:** Are the inputs reasonable and clearly stated?
2. **Unit economics:** Does each customer generate profit over their lifetime?
3. **Burn rate:** How efficiently are you spending?
4. **Runway:** How long until you need more money?
5. **Path to next milestone:** What do you need to achieve to raise Series A?

They're not looking for perfect predictions—they're assessing whether you understand your business drivers and can think clearly about the future.

## Tools for Financial Modeling

| Tool | Best For | Cost |
|------|----------|------|
| **Google Sheets** | Early stage, collaboration | Free |
| **Excel** | Complex models, scenario analysis | Part of Microsoft 365 |
| **Causal** | Connected models, automatic charts | From £50/month |
| **Runway** | Real-time actuals integration | From £100/month |

For seed-stage startups, Google Sheets is usually sufficient. The tool matters less than the thinking behind the model.

## Template Structure

A well-organised model typically has these tabs:

1. **Dashboard** - Key metrics summary, charts
2. **Assumptions** - All inputs in one place
3. **Revenue** - Detailed revenue build-up
4. **Headcount** - Hiring plan with costs
5. **Operating Expenses** - Non-headcount costs
6. **P&L** - Profit and loss summary
7. **Cash Flow** - Monthly cash projection
8. **Scenarios** - Upside/downside cases

## Next Steps

1. **Start simple:** Build a 12-month model in Google Sheets before adding complexity
2. **Validate assumptions:** Compare your metrics to industry benchmarks
3. **Update monthly:** A model is only useful if it reflects current reality
4. **Get feedback:** Have a CFO or financial advisor review before investor meetings

Financial modeling is a skill that improves with practice. Your first model won't be perfect—but building it will force you to think rigorously about your business, and that clarity is valuable whether or not you raise funding.
