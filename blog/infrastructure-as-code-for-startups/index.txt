# Configure the AWS provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# Create an S3 bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "example-bucket"
}
### Pulumi

Pulumi leverages general‑purpose languages (TypeScript, Python, Go, C#) to define infrastructure. This can lower the learning curve for teams already comfortable with those languages.

```typescript
// File: index.ts

import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";

// Create an S3 bucket
const bucket = new aws.s3.Bucket("example", {
  bucket: "example-bucket",
});

// Export the bucket name
export const bucketName = bucket.bucket;
### Terraform vs. Pulumi

| Feature | Terraform | Pulumi |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Ease of Use** | Easy for beginners, declarative syntax | Steeper learning curve, imperative style |
| **Configuration Language** | HCL (domain‑specific) | General‑purpose languages |
| **Community & Ecosystem** | Broad, many providers | Growing, but smaller community |
| **State Management** | Remote backends (S3, Consul, Terraform Cloud) | Managed state in Pulumi Service or self‑hosted |
| **Testing & CI Integration** | Mature tooling (Terratest, InSpec) | Native support for unit tests in chosen language |

Both tools are capable of managing multi‑cloud environments, but the choice often comes down to team skill sets and organizational preferences.

## Structured Implementation Roadmap

1. **Choose a Tooling Stack**  
   Evaluate your team’s language proficiency, provider requirements, and governance needs. Start with a single tool to reduce complexity.

2. **Define a Repository Structure**  
   Adopt a monorepo or multi‑repo strategy. A common layout:

   ├── modules/
   │   ├── vpc/
   │   └── s3/
   ├── environments/
   │   ├── dev/
   │   ├── staging/
   │   └── prod/
   └── README.md

Whether you choose Terraform’s declarative model or Pulumi’s language‑friendly approach, the key is to embed IaC into your development lifecycle from day one. Adopt a modular, version‑controlled, and CI‑driven workflow, and you’ll be well‑positioned to deliver reliable services that grow with your user base."}]
