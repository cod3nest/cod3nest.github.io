  region = "us-west-2"
}
### Declaring Resources

A resource block describes a concrete AWS object. Terraform applies the block to create, update, or delete the resource.

```terraform
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-abc123"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
> **Note:** This example is intentionally minimal; production deployments typically include network interfaces, IAM roles, security groups, and tags.

### Modules and Reusability

Modules encapsulate reusable infrastructure patterns. They can be sourced locally or from the public registry.

```terraform
module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "~> 3.0"

  name = "my-vpc"
  cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"

  azs             = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b"]
  public_subnets  = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"]
  private_subnets = ["10.0.101.0/24", "10.0.102.0/24"]
}
### Remote State Management

Local state files (`terraform.tfstate`) are unsuitable for shared environments. Remote backends, such as AWS S3 with DynamoDB locks, provide a single source of truth.

```terraform
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
    key            = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-2"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
> **Best Practice:** Enable state locking and encryption to prevent concurrent modifications and protect sensitive data.

### Version Pinning

Locking provider and module versions guarantees that deployments are reproducible across environments.

terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.3, < 2.0"

  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
