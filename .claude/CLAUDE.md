You are an expert Next.js engineer and brand strategist.
I already have a Next.js website in a GitHub repository, and I want to **rewrite and reposition it** for my consultancy business.

### Goal:
Transform the existing website into a **professional, founder-focused IT consultancy site** that targets **startups going from 0→1**, highlighting my **unique approach using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps** for rapid, reliable iteration.

### Company Overview:
- Focus: Helping startups move from concept to scalable product.
- Services: Fractional CTO, Product Architecture, MVP Engineering, AI/Data Integration, Technical Due Diligence.
- USP: I deliver speed *and* structure — by using **templated cloud architectures**, **IaC**, and **GitOps**, I help teams build quickly while maintaining production-grade standards and observability.
- Tone: Confident, technical, clear, startup-savvy (no emojis, no fluff).
- Style: Modern, minimal, founder-oriented design. Neutral colors, clean typography.

### Tasks:

1. **Rewrite content across all pages** to reflect:
    - Startup and founder audience.
    - The 0→1 journey (from idea → prototype → scalable architecture).
    - The benefits of IaC and GitOps as enablers of agility, speed, and reliability.
    - Clear outcomes: faster delivery, cleaner handovers, scalable systems.

2. **Homepage**
    - Hero section headline:  
      “From Idea to Scalable Product — Technical Leadership for Startups.”
    - Subtext:  
      “We help founders build fast and scale smart — combining engineering execution with reproducible IaC and GitOps foundations.”
    - CTA: “Book a Discovery Call.”
    - Add short sections for:
        - What We Do (Fractional CTO, MVP Delivery, AI & Cloud)
        - Why It Works (IaC & GitOps efficiency)
        - Testimonials placeholder

3. **Services Page**
   Update with clear, benefit-driven service descriptions:
    - *Fractional CTO* — technical leadership, team scaling, architecture reviews.
    - *0→1 Product Builds* — MVP development using modular, cloud-native templates.
    - *AI & Data Engineering* — LLM integration, MLOps, and scalable data pipelines.
    - *IaC & GitOps Acceleration* — reproducible environments and CI/CD pipelines for faster iteration and reliable delivery.
    - *Technical Due Diligence* — investor readiness, scalability audits, and system design assessments.

4. **Approach Page**
   Outline the 3-stage model:
    - *Discover & Define*: clarify vision, user value, and product scope.
    - *Architect & Accelerate*: establish IaC, CI/CD, and GitOps templates before coding.
    - *Deliver & Handover*: launch MVP, ensure observability, document ownership.

   Emphasize: “Every engagement begins with a production-grade foundation — so iteration is safe, fast, and measurable.”

5. **About Page**
    - Founder story: experienced startup engineer who has built and led teams, guided early-stage founders, and implemented repeatable technical frameworks for speed.
    - Values: clarity, reliability, craftsmanship.
    - Mention IaC and GitOps philosophy: “We believe speed comes from structure — Infrastructure as Code and GitOps bring the discipline startups need without slowing innovation.”

6. **Contact Page**
    - Professional contact form with validation.
    - Call to action: “Let’s discuss your next product milestone.”
    - Placeholder for Calendly or email.

### Technical Instructions:
- Maintain current design system, layout, and styling, but update text and minor structure to reflect new focus.
- Keep code compatible with Next.js App Router.
- Retain Tailwind CSS styling.
- Update SEO metadata to reflect new positioning:  
  Keywords: “startup CTO”, “fractional CTO”, “0-1 product”, “GitOps consulting”, “Infrastructure as Code”, “startup technical partner”.
- Ensure the site remains deployable to GitHub Pages.
- Keep all copy professional, concise, and technical — **no emojis**.

Output:
1. Updated code for all rewritten pages.
2. Updated metadata and README if needed.
3. A short note explaining how the new positioning strengthens founder appeal and differentiates the consultancy.
