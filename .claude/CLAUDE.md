# Rewrite Next.js Consultancy Website for GitHub Pages

You are an expert **Next.js engineer** and **brand strategist**.

I already have a **Next.js website in a GitHub repository**, currently deployed via **GitHub Pages**, and I want to **rewrite and reposition it** for my consultancy business.

---

## Goal
Transform the existing website into a **professional, founder-focused IT consultancy site** that targets **startups going from 0→1**, highlighting my **unique approach using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps** for rapid, reliable iteration.

---

## Company Overview
- **Focus:** Helping startups move from concept to scalable product.
- **Services:** Fractional CTO, Product Architecture, MVP Engineering, AI/Data Integration, Technical Due Diligence.
- **USP:** I deliver speed *and* structure — using **templated cloud architectures**, **IaC**, and **GitOps**, I help teams build quickly while maintaining production-grade standards and observability.
- **Tone:** Confident, technical, clear, startup-savvy (no emojis, no fluff).
- **Style:** Modern, minimal, founder-oriented design. Neutral colors, clean typography.
